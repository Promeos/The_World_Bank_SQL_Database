## Background

### The World Bank
<strong>The World Bank</strong> is an international financial institution that provides financing to governments of low- and middle-income countries for the purpose of pursuing capital. It comprises two institutions: the **International Bank for Reconstruction and Development** (IBRD), and the **International Development Association** (IDA).


Together, IBRD and IDA form the World Bank, which provides financing, policy advice, and technical assistance to governments of developing countries.  IDA focuses on the worldâ€™s poorest countries, while IBRD assists middle-income and creditworthy poorer countries.
